# CS Club GitHub Fundamentals Challenge

Welcome to the GitHub challenge!

In this activity, you will learn how people collaborate on projects using GitHub.

You will:
- Explore a repository
- Create a branch
- Make a change
- Commit your work
- Open a pull request

---

# Goal

Your goal is to successfully contribute something to this project using GitHub.

By the end of the challenge, your name or idea should appear in the repository history.

---

# Step 1 — Explore the Repository

Take a minute to look around.

Things to check:
- The files in the project
- The Insights / Contributors section
- The commit history

This shows how projects grow over time.

---

# Step 2 — Create a Branch

Create your own branch using:
- Your name
- Your nickname
- Your team name

Example:
zach-branch

Branches allow multiple people to work at the same time.

---

# Step 3 — Make a Small Change

Now make **one small improvement** to the project.

You can choose one:

Add your name and favortie programming language to:
contributors.md

Add a project idea to:
ideas.md

Add a short message somewhere in the project.

---

# Step 4 — Commit Your Change

When you save your change on GitHub, you will create a **commit**.

A commit is a saved change in the project history.

Write a short message explaining what you added.

Example:
Added my name to contributors

---

# Step 5 — Open a Pull Request

After committing your change:

Open a Pull Request.

A pull request is how developers suggest changes to a project.

This allows others to:
- Review your change
- Comment on it
- Approve it
